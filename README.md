# daqhats-mocks
!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!

## Goal
Aims to provide a mock-implementation of the MCC daqhats python library for testing your python application on a local machine.

Daqhats-mocks will be configurable, so that you can define ...
- the type of analog signal to mock for MCC's ADC boards
- the type of trigger signals to mock for MCC's DIO boards
